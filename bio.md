### I like to code.

Other hobbies of mine include aviation, model aircraft, PCs, space, general nerd things and twisty puzzles/Rubik's cubes.

Favourite language:
Python, although I'll use C# and Java on larger projects for performance and strict typing. I hate JavaScript because of its implicit type conversions. For some reason, I still write JavaScript a lot though.

Favourite paradigm:
Object oriented programming

Main OS:
Manjaro Linux but I generally like all Linuces.

Programs I like:
- Godot
- vscode
- Blender
- Kdenlive
- Inkscape

Games I like:
- FlightGear
- SuperTuxKart
- OpenTTD
- Kerbal Space Program

You can find me as ThatCoolCoder on replit.com, stackexchange, Github and itch.io (and probably some other places that I forgot).
