### I like to code.

Other hobbies of mine include aviation, model aircraft, PCs, space, general nerd things and twisty puzzles/Rubik's cubes.

Favourite languages:
For larger projects, I like C# and Rust. Python is great for smaller things. Java is okay but I dislike the lack of tooling consistency (eg Maven vs Ant vs ...). I hate JavaScript because of its implicit type conversions and other oddities. For some reason, I still write JavaScript a lot though.

Favourite paradigm:
Object oriented programming mainly, but functional programming can be really useful in some situations.

Main OS:
Manjaro Linux but I generally like all Linuces, especially Arch-based ones.

Programs I like:
- Godot
- vscode
- Blender
- Kdenlive
- Inkscape
- Firefox
- Pixelorama

Games I like:
- FlightGear
- SuperTuxKart
- OpenTTD
- MegaGlest
- Minetest (specifically NodeCore)
- Kerbal Space Program

You can find me as ThatCoolCoder on replit.com, stackexchange, Github and itch.io (and probably some other places that I forgot).
