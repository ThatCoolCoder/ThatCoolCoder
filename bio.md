# ThatCoolCoder

### I like to code.

Other hobbies of mine include aviation, model aircraft, PCs, space, general nerd things and twisty puzzles/Rubik's cubes.

#### Favourite languages:

For larger projects, I will use C# or Rust. Python is great for smaller things. Java is okay but the lack of tooling consistency (eg Maven vs Ant vs ...) is somewhat annoying. I strongly dislike JavaScript because of the many oddities embedded in the language such as the implicit type conversions. For some reason, I still write JavaScript a lot though.

#### Favourite paradigm:
I generally structure my programs adhering to OOP, but using some functional programming techniques beside this can be helpful in many cases.

#### Main OS:
Manjaro Linux. I generally like all Linux distros, especially Arch-based ones.

#### Programs I like:
- Godot
- vscode
- Blender
- Kdenlive
- Inkscape
- Firefox
- Pixelorama

#### Games I like:
- FlightGear
- SuperTuxKart
- OpenTTD
- MegaGlest
- Minetest (specifically NodeCore)
- Kerbal Space Program
