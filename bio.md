# ThatCoolCoder

### I like to code.

Other hobbies of mine include aviation, model aircraft, PCs, space, general nerd things and twisty puzzles/Rubik's cubes.

#### Favourite languages:

For larger projects, I will use C# or Rust. Python is great for smaller things or one-off tools. Although I do not particularly like Javascript as a language (due to its numerous oddities), I still use it a lot as it is required for web development.

#### Favourite paradigm:
I generally find myself using OOP as a means of high-level organisation, but also believe that functional programming techniques beside this can be helpful in many cases.

#### Main OS:
Manjaro Linux. I generally like all Linux distros, especially Arch-based ones.

#### Programs I like:
- Godot
- vscode
- Blender
- Kdenlive
- Inkscape
- Firefox
- Pixelorama

#### Games I like:
- FlightGear
- SuperTuxKart
- OpenTTD
- MegaGlest
- Minetest (specifically NodeCore)
- Kerbal Space Program
